# Websockets

- A simple client-server application that uses websockets to simulate live text updates between two clients.

- The purpose of this project is to get a hands-on understanding of how websockets work and their application in real-time applications like Google Docs

# Usage:

1. Run the server by running `node index` in the doc-colab/server directory. (do this first)
2. Start the react development server by running `npm start` in the doc-colab/client directory
3. Open two or more tabs with the client application (http://localhost:3000/) and type into the text box
